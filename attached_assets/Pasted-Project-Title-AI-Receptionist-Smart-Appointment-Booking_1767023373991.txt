🛠 Tech & Replit Setup

Prompt to Enter in Replit (AI-Agent Assisted Build):

Create a modern, responsive marketing website called "AI Receptionist – Appointment Booking Agent" with a light theme (white and blue accent colors). Include a hero section with a bold headline, multi-channel product description, key features, benefits, testimonials, and clear CTAs (“Get Started”, “Request Demo”). Use HTML, CSS (or Tailwind), and JavaScript for interactivity. Make sure the site is mobile-friendly. Add sample UI graphics for chat, WhatsApp and voice scheduling interactions, and a signup form for lead capture. 


You can paste that prompt into the Replit App → AI Agent tab to generate the project skeleton; Replit will scaffold HTML/CSS/JS files for you.
